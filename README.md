- 👋 Hi, I’m @AArizaV1, a passionate software developer from Spain

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Solera, Inc**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **about different languages and frameworks, for example:**
                                **[BACK-END Development] -> learning more about JavaScript, Java, .NET ...**
